## About
This project is all about testing PHP patterns, PHP Unit, Jenkins and other tools.

- lib/Goiaba works as the backend of a simple MVC framework that runs in src/App

Some of the components included thus far:
- FrontController Design Pattern (lib/Goiaba)
- PHPUnit 
- Composer (dependencies and autoloader psr-4)

Future components:
- twitter bootstrap
- jenkins, php codesniffer
- more design patterns (maybe a 'Register' for config files, 'Active Record' ORM)
- possible ORMs: doctrine or eloquent
- consume a RESTful API (Twitter)
- vagrant
- angular js
- unix scripting (db backups and instalation script)
